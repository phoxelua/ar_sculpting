Camera calibration
1. Retrieve intrinsic parameters using MATLAB calibrator on checkboard. Save this to reuse forever.

Create 3D Model
1. Capture object from various angles ~12. Do this with a fuducial markers.
Optional but pretty much have to: Segment the object from the background in each of the images. Use TVSeg or GrabCut
2. Retrieve extrinsic parameters using MATLAB ARToolKit port and MATLAB Camera Calibration tool.

Overlay in Live Video Stream
1. Pass parameters annd images into voxel coloring framework
2. Insert into video stream using ARToolKit


Intrinsic parameters: focal length, lens distortion coeff
Extrinsic parameters: cams location in 3D space in relation to fixed obj

Use MATLAB camera calibrator by running "cameraCalibrator" to retrieve these
but for extrinsics use 4 fiducial markers along with ARToolkit to automatically retrieve
